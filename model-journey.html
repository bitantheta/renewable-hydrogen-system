      <h1>How the Model Works</h1>
      <p>
        This page walks through how a simple electrochemical idea was gradually
        expanded into a full renewable-integrated hydrogen system model.
        Each section adds one layer of physical realism.

  <!-- STAGE TITLE -->
  <h2>1. Starting from a Single Electrolyzer Cell</h2>

  <!-- PART 1: FOUNDATION -->
  <div class="stage-text full">
    <h3>Why the Electrolyzer Cell Is the Starting Point</h3>

    <p>
      Every hydrogen production system, no matter how large or complex, is built
      from a single repeating physical unit: the electrolyzer cell. Before it is
      meaningful to discuss stacks, cooling loops, power electronics, or
      renewable integration, we must first understand what happens inside one
      cell when electrical energy is supplied.
    </p>

    <p>
      An electrolyzer cell is where electrical energy is directly converted into
      chemical energy by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. The rate at
      which hydrogen is produced, the electrical power required to sustain the
      reaction, and the amount of heat generated are all determined locally at
      this scale. Larger systems do not change this physics — they only scale it,
      distribute it, or impose additional constraints on it.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- PART 2: FARADAY -->
  <div class="explain-block highlight full">
    <p>
      <strong>Key physical law:</strong> Hydrogen production follows directly
      from Faraday’s law. The amount of hydrogen generated is proportional to the
      electrical current passing through the cell.
    </p>

    <p>
      This proportionality is exact and universal. Whether the system contains a
      single cell or tens of thousands, every electron contributes identically
      to hydrogen formation.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- PART 3: CONTROL VARIABLE -->
  <div class="stage-text full">
    <p>
      For this reason, <strong>current density</strong> — the current per unit
      active area — becomes the natural control variable for electrolyzer
      operation. System size does not change electrochemistry; it only changes
      how current is distributed across cells.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- PART 4: VOLTAGE FLOOR -->
  <div class="stage-text full">
    <h3>Why Voltage Is Not Freely Chosen</h3>

    <p>
      The voltage required to drive the electrochemical reaction is not
      arbitrary. It is set by fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic
      considerations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even under ideal conditions, a minimum voltage is required to split water.
      This minimum — the <strong>reversible voltage</strong> — corresponds to the
      Gibbs free energy change of the reaction and represents the absolute lower
      bound on energy consumption.

  </div>

  <!-- PART 5: LOSSES -->
  <div class="stage-text full">
    <p>
      Real electrolyzer cells must operate at voltages higher than this
      reversible minimum because all practical electrochemical processes
      exhibit irreversible losses. These losses arise from two distinct
      physical mechanisms:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Activation losses</strong> — energy required to overcome kinetic
        barriers at electrode surfaces
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ohmic losses</strong> — resistive losses within membranes,
        electrodes, and current collectors
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- INTERPRETATION CALLOUT -->
  <div class="explain-block highlight full">
    <p>
      The reversible voltage sets a hard thermodynamic floor. Activation and
      ohmic losses represent the unavoidable price paid for operating the
      reaction at a finite rate.
    </p>

    <p>
      As current density increases, these penalties grow. The operating voltage
      therefore rises not because of poor design, but because irreversibility is
      fundamental to electrochemical energy conversion.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- PART 6: ENERGY & HEAT -->
  <div class="stage-text full">
    <h3>Where the Energy Goes</h3>

    <p>
      Electrical power input to the cell is given by the product of voltage and
      current. Only a portion of this power is stored as chemical energy in
      hydrogen.
    </p>

    <p>
      The remaining fraction, arising from irreversible losses, must appear as
      heat within the cell. Heat generation is therefore not a flaw to be
      eliminated, but a fundamental consequence of operating any real
      electrochemical system at finite current.

    <p>
      These cell-level relationships form the foundation of the entire system
      model. Stack scaling redistributes current density, cooling systems exist
      to remove generated heat, and power and thermal limits emerge directly
      from voltage rise.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the next section, we examine how the voltage–current relationship
      shapes feasible operating regimes and begins to impose hard constraints
      on system-level performance.

  <!-- STAGE TITLE -->
  <h2>2. Thermal Dynamics and Energy Balance</h2>

  <!-- PART 1: PROBLEM SETUP -->
  <div class="stage-text full">
    <h3>Where the Electrical Losses Go</h3>

    <p>
      Electrical losses inside the electrolyzer do not disappear. The difference
      between the electrical power supplied to the cell and the reversible
      chemical energy stored in hydrogen must appear as heat within the cell
      structure.
    </p>

    <p>
      This heat is generated continuously during operation and accumulates
      locally within the electrodes, membrane, and electrolyte. As a result,
      cell temperature does not remain fixed when current increases.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- PART 2: KEY CONCEPT -->
  <div class="explain-block highlight full">
    <p>
      <strong>Key idea:</strong> Cell temperature is not a control variable.
      It is an outcome of energy balance between internally generated heat
      and externally removed heat.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- PART 3: TEMPERATURE AS AN OUTCOME -->
  <div class="stage-text full">
    <p>
      When an electrolyzer begins operating, heat generation exceeds heat
      removal and the cell temperature rises. This rise continues until the
      rate of heat rejection to the coolant exactly balances the rate of heat
      generation inside the cell.
    </p>

    <p>
      The resulting operating temperature is therefore a steady-state solution,
      not a setpoint chosen independently by the operator. Any change in
      current, cooling effectiveness, or coolant temperature shifts this
      balance and produces a new steady temperature.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- ENERGY BALANCE EQUATION -->
  <div class="equation-band full">
    <div class="equation-block">
      \[
      \dot{Q}_{\text{gen}} = UA \,(T_{\text{cell}} - T_{\text{cool}})
      \]
      <p class="equation-caption">
        Steady-state balance between internally generated heat and heat removed
        by the cooling system
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- PART 4: PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION -->
  <div class="stage-text full">
    <p>
      In this balance, the left-hand side represents heat generated by
      irreversible electrochemical losses, which increases strongly with
      current density. The right-hand side represents the ability of the
      cooling system to remove heat, characterized by the overall heat transfer
      coefficient multiplied by effective area, denoted as <strong>UA</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The temperature difference between the cell and the coolant adjusts until
      these two rates are equal. A larger cooling effectiveness (higher UA)
      reduces the temperature rise required to remove the same amount of heat.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- PART 5: WHY TEMPERATURE RISES WITH CURRENT -->
  <div class="stage-text full">
    <h3>Why Temperature Rises as Current Increases</h3>

    <p>
      As current density increases, hydrogen production rises linearly, but
      heat generation rises more rapidly due to increasing voltage losses.
      Cooling capacity, however, does not automatically scale with current.
    </p>

    <p>
      The result is a monotonic rise in cell temperature with increasing
      current density. This rise occurs even under perfectly controlled
      operation and reflects a fundamental coupling between electrochemistry
      and thermal physics.
    </p>
  </div>

        Cell temperature increases with current density as internally generated
        heat grows faster than cooling capacity. Cooling effectiveness controls
        the slope of this temperature rise.
      </p>
    </div>

  </div>

  <!-- PART 6: THERMAL LIMITS -->
  <div class="explain-block highlight full">
    <p>
      Thermal limits are hard constraints, not performance targets. Above certain
      temperatures, membranes degrade, catalysts lose activity, and material
      lifetimes shorten rapidly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Safe operation therefore requires that current density be limited such
      that the steady-state temperature remains below allowable thresholds.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- PART 7: BRIDGE TO SYSTEM CONSTRAINTS -->
  <div class="stage-text full">
    <p>
      Once thermal limits are reached, the system can no longer follow purely
      electrical optimization. Even if additional power and capacity are
      available, temperature constraints prevent further increases in current.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the following sections, we examine how stack scaling, cooling design,
      and renewable integration interact with this thermal balance to define
      the feasible operating envelope of the full hydrogen production system.

  <!-- STAGE TITLE -->
  <h2>3. From a Single Cell to an Electrolyzer Stack</h2>

  <!-- PART 1: WHY STACKS EXIST -->
  <div class="stage-text full">
    <h3>Why Industrial Electrolyzers Use Stacks</h3>

    <p>
      Industrial electrolyzers are not single cells. They consist of many
      electrochemical cells connected electrically in series to form a stack.
      This configuration allows hydrogen production to be scaled to industrial
      levels while preserving the same underlying electrochemical behavior at
      the cell level.
    </p>

    <p>
      Importantly, stacking cells does not change the physics of water
      electrolysis. Each individual cell still obeys the same voltage–current
      relationship, generates heat in the same way, and produces hydrogen
      according to Faraday’s law.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- PART 2: WHAT SCALES -->
  <div class="explain-block highlight full">
    <p>
      <strong>Key idea:</strong> Stack-level behavior emerges directly from
      cell-level physics, amplified by scale. Nothing new is introduced —
      existing physical relationships are repeated many times.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- PART 3: VOLTAGE SCALING -->
  <div class="stage-text full">
    <h3>How Voltage Scales in a Stack</h3>

    <p>
      Because cells in a stack are connected in series, the total stack voltage
      is simply the sum of the individual cell voltages. If each cell operates
      at the same current density, the stack voltage increases linearly with the
      number of cells.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- STACK SCALING EQUATION -->
  <div class="equation-band full">

      <p class="equation-caption">
        Stack voltage increases linearly as identical cells are connected in series

    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- PART 4: INTERPRETATION -->
  <div class="stage-text full">
    <p>
      While the magnitude of the voltage increases with the number of cells,
      the *shape* of the voltage–current relationship remains unchanged. All
      nonlinear behavior introduced by activation and ohmic losses is inherited
      directly from the single-cell response.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a result, increasing stack size does not make high-current operation
      easier — it simply raises the absolute voltage and power involved.

  <!-- PART 5: POWER SCALING -->
  <div class="stage-text full">
    <h3>Why Power Becomes a System-Level Challenge</h3>

    <p>
      Electrical power consumed by the stack is given by the product of stack
      voltage and current. Because both voltage and current increase with
      operating intensity and scale, stack power grows rapidly as systems
      become larger.
    </p>

    <p>
      This rapid growth in power explains why power electronics, grid
      integration, and thermal management become dominant engineering concerns
      at the stack and plant level.

      Larger stacks therefore amplify both productive output and the
      consequences of irreversible losses.

      At the stack level, system behavior begins to encounter hard external

      systems limit heat rejection, and component ratings impose safe operating
      envelopes.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the next section, we examine how cooling effectiveness and thermal
      constraints impose explicit operating limits on stack power and define

  <h2>4. Cooling as a Hard Constraint</h2>

  <!-- PART 1: SETTING THE LIMIT -->
  <div class="stage-text full">
    <h3>Why Cooling Ultimately Limits Operation</h3>

    <p>
      Heat generated inside the electrolyzer must be continuously removed by
      the cooling system. While electrochemical considerations may favor higher
      current densities to increase hydrogen production, cooling capacity
      ultimately determines whether a given operating point is physically
      achievable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cooling systems do not merely influence performance — they define the
      boundary between feasible and infeasible operation. Once heat can no
      longer be removed fast enough, temperature rises without bound.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- KEY IDEA CALLOUT -->
  <div class="explain-block highlight full">
    <p>
      <strong>Key idea:</strong> Cooling imposes a hard physical limit. Beyond

      produce a safe steady operating point.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- PART 2: TEMPERATURE AS A CONSTRAINT -->
  <div class="stage-text full">
    <p>
      All electrolyzer components — membranes, catalysts, seals, and structural
      materials — have maximum allowable operating temperatures. Exceeding
      these limits leads to rapid degradation, loss of performance, and
      potentially unsafe operation.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a result, electrolyzers are designed to operate below a specified
      maximum cell temperature. This requirement converts thermal behavior
      from a continuous trade-off into a strict constraint.

    <p>
      At low and moderate current densities, the cooling system can reject the

      rises and the steady-state temperature moves closer to the allowable
      maximum.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond a critical current density, no steady temperature solution exists
      below the safe limit. At this point, continued operation would cause the
      cell temperature to exceed material limits, making the operating point
      physically infeasible.

  <h2>5. Control and Protection Logic</h2>

  <!-- PART 1: WHY CONTROL IS NEEDED -->

    <h3>Why Electrolyzers Cannot Operate Freely</h3>

    <p>
      Real electrolyzers do not operate at arbitrary points on the physical
      performance curves defined by electrochemistry and thermal behavior.
      Although power availability or operator demand may request aggressive
      operating conditions, the system must always remain within safe limits.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this reason, electrolyzers are equipped with control and protection
      logic that continuously monitors key variables such as voltage,
      temperature, and current ramp rate.

  <div class="stage-text full">
    <p>
      When a constraint becomes active, the control system does not shut the
      electrolyzer down abruptly. Instead, it derates operation smoothly,
      reducing current density to maintain operation within allowable limits.
    </p>

    <p>
      This derating trades instantaneous hydrogen production for equipment
      safety, reliability, and long-term performance. It is therefore a
      deliberate design feature, not a failure mode.

  <!-- PART 4: WHY CONTROL CANNOT OVERRIDE PHYSICS -->
  <div class="explain-block highlight full">
    <p>
      Control logic cannot override physical limits. If an operating point is
      thermally or electrically infeasible, no control strategy can make it
      safe.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead, control systems ensure that the electrolyzer operates at the
      maximum safe point allowed by the most restrictive active constraint.

  <!-- PART 5: BRIDGE TO SYSTEM-LEVEL REGIMES -->

      As operating conditions change, different constraints become active.

      higher power, electrical capacity or thermal limits may dominate.

  <h2>6. Renewable Power Integration</h2>

  <!-- PART 1: VARIABILITY AS A GIVEN -->
  <div class="stage-text full">
    <h3>Why Renewable Power Changes the Operating Problem</h3>

    <p>
      When powered by renewable energy sources such as solar or wind, the
      electrolyzer no longer receives a steady, dispatchable power input.
      Instead, available power varies continuously over time according to
      environmental conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The electrolyzer must therefore respond dynamically to changing power
      availability while still respecting all electrochemical, thermal, and
      protection constraints developed in the previous sections.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- KEY IDEA CALLOUT -->
  <div class="explain-block highlight full">
    <p>
      <strong>Key idea:</strong> The system can only absorb renewable power that
      lies within its feasible operating envelope. Availability alone does not
      guarantee usability.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- PART 2: IDEALIZED RENEWABLE PROFILE -->
  <div class="stage-text full">
    <p>
      To illustrate this interaction, an idealized daily solar power profile is
      often used. Power rises smoothly in the morning, reaches a peak near
      midday, and falls again toward evening.
    </p>

    <p>
      This simplified profile captures the essential feature of renewable

  <!-- PART 3: FEASIBILITY FILTER -->
  <div class="stage-text full">
    <p>
      At each moment in time, the control system compares the power requested
      by the renewable source with the maximum power the electrolyzer can safely
      absorb. This maximum is determined by voltage limits, thermal constraints,
      and control logic.
    </p>

    <p>
      If available renewable power exceeds the feasible operating limit, the
      electrolyzer cannot absorb the excess without violating physical or
      safety constraints.

  <!-- PART 4: CURTAILMENT EXPLAINED -->
  <div class="explain-block highlight full">
    <p>
      Curtailment occurs whenever available renewable power exceeds what the
      electrolyzer can safely absorb. This excess energy is not converted to
      hydrogen and is therefore lost from the perspective of the electrolyzer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Curtailment is not a control failure or inefficiency — it is the inevitable
      result of finite electrolyzer capacity interacting with variable
      renewable supply.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- PART 5: SYSTEM-LEVEL CONSEQUENCES -->
  <div class="stage-text full">
    <p>
      The balance between renewable availability and system feasibility governs
      real-world hydrogen production. Increasing renewable capacity without
      increasing electrolyzer or cooling capacity leads to higher curtailment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Conversely, oversizing the electrolyzer relative to renewable supply
      reduces curtailment but lowers utilization. These trade-offs define the
      design space explored in the System Explorer.

      The combined effects of electrochemistry, thermal constraints, control

    </p>

    <p>
      While earlier sections focused on physical feasibility, real systems are
      evaluated using performance metrics that summarize these interactions

  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <div class="stage-text full">
    <p>
      At the system level, performance does not improve linearly with design
      effort. Increasing renewable capacity, electrolyzer size, or operating
      aggressiveness each targets a different bottleneck — and only helps until
      another constraint becomes active.

      This section explores how design choices interact with physical limits,
      revealing where additional investment produces meaningful gains and where
      it leads to diminishing returns.

    <h3>8.1 Renewable Oversizing</h3>

    <p>
      Renewable oversizing increases the amount of power available to the
      electrolyzer, raising potential hydrogen production during high-resource
      periods. However, the electrolyzer can only absorb power up to its
      electrochemical, thermal, and control limits.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once these limits are reached, additional renewable power is curtailed
      rather than converted into hydrogen. Beyond this point, further oversizing
      produces diminishing returns.
