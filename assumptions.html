      <h1>Assumptions & Limits</h1>
      <p>
        This page documents the key assumptions used in the model and clarifies
        what the results should — and should not — be interpreted as.
        The intent is transparency, not to hide complexity.
      </p>
    </header>

    <!-- SECTION 1 -->
    <section class="how-section">
      <h2>1. Scope of the Model</h2>
      <p>
        The model is a reduced-order representation of a renewable-powered
        electrolyzer system. It is designed to capture dominant physical and
        operational trade-offs, not to replace detailed stack-level or plant-level
        simulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Results are most useful for comparative reasoning, sensitivity analysis,
        and intuition-building rather than absolute design certification.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 2 -->
    <section class="how-section">
      <h2>2. Renewable Power Representation</h2>
      <p>
        Renewable input is treated as an exogenous power source with no internal
        dynamics, forecasting uncertainty, or grid interaction effects.
        Temporal variability is simplified to focus on system-level constraints.
      </p>
      <p>
        Energy storage, curtailment markets, and grid export are not modeled
        explicitly.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 3 -->
    <section class="how-section">
      <h2>3. Electrolyzer Modeling Assumptions</h2>
      <p>
        Electrochemical behavior is represented using a lumped polarization
        relationship. Spatial gradients, degradation mechanisms, and transient
        electrochemistry are neglected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stack scaling is assumed linear, meaning performance scales proportionally
        with cell count. Balance-of-plant effects are not explicitly included.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 4 -->
    <section class="how-section">
      <h2>4. Thermal Model Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        The thermal model assumes a single effective stack temperature and a
        simplified heat removal mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Local hot spots, coolant maldistribution, and startup/shutdown thermal
        transients are outside the scope of this representation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 5 -->
    <section class="how-section">
      <h2>5. Control and Operational Constraints</h2>
      <p>
        Control logic is rule-based and prioritizes feasibility and safety over
        optimization. Voltage limits, temperature limits, and ramp-rate limits
        are enforced deterministically.
      </p>
      <p>
        Advanced predictive control, economic dispatch, and degradation-aware
        control strategies are not included.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 6 -->
    <section class="how-section how-highlight">
      <h2>6. How to Interpret the Results</h2>
      <p>
        The model outputs should be interpreted as feasible operating trends,
        not exact production guarantees.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a parameter change does not increase hydrogen output, it indicates
        that another constraint has become limiting — not that the model is
        malfunctioning.
      </p>

        Within these assumptions, the model provides a physically grounded and
        transparent framework for understanding renewable hydrogen system behavior.
