      <h1>How the Model Works</h1>
      <p>
        This page explains the physical reasoning and control logic behind the
        renewable-powered hydrogen system model. The goal is not mathematical
        detail, but clear intuition for why the system behaves the way it does.
      </p>
    </header>

    <!-- SECTION 1 -->
    <section class="how-section">
      <h2>1. Energy Flow Through the System</h2>
      <p>
        The system begins with renewable electricity, which is routed to an
        electrolyzer stack to produce hydrogen. This conversion is not perfect:
        some electrical energy is converted into chemical energy (hydrogen),
        while the remainder appears as heat.
      </p>
      <p>
        At any moment, hydrogen production is limited by the weakest part of the
        chain: available renewable power, electrolyzer capacity, or thermal
        constraints. Excess renewable energy cannot be stored implicitly and is
        curtailed if downstream systems cannot accept it.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 2 -->
    <section class="how-section">
      <h2>2. Electrochemical Behavior of the Electrolyzer</h2>
      <p>
        Inside the electrolyzer, hydrogen production increases with electrical
        current. However, operating at higher current densities raises the cell
        voltage due to electrochemical losses. This reduces efficiency and
        increases heat generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, there is a practical limit to how aggressively the
        electrolyzer can be driven. Producing more hydrogen always comes at the
        cost of higher electrical consumption per unit of hydrogen.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 3 -->
    <section class="how-section">
      <h2>3. Thermal Constraints and Cooling</h2>
      <p>
        Heat generated within the stack must be removed to keep temperatures
        within safe operating limits. Cooling systems extract this heat, but
        their effectiveness is finite.
      </p>
      <p>
        If cooling is insufficient, the control system must reduce current to
        avoid excessive temperatures. This directly limits hydrogen production,
        even when electrical power and electrolyzer capacity are available.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 4 -->
    <section class="how-section">
      <h2>4. Control Logic and Safe Operation</h2>
      <p>
        The model includes control logic that prioritizes safe and stable
        operation. Power input is followed only as long as voltage, temperature,
        and ramp-rate constraints are respected.
      </p>
      <p>
        When any constraint becomes active, the system automatically derates
        operation. This ensures feasibility, but also explains why hydrogen
        output does not always increase linearly with available power.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 5 -->
    <section class="how-section">
      <h2>5. The Feasible Operating Envelope</h2>
      <p>
        By simulating the system across a range of renewable oversizing ratios,
        the model identifies a feasible operating envelope. This envelope
        represents the maximum hydrogen production achievable without violating
        any physical or control limits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Increasing renewable capacity initially increases hydrogen output, but
        eventually encounters diminishing returns as electrolyzer capacity or
        thermal constraints become limiting.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 6 (HIGHLIGHT) -->
    <section class="how-section how-highlight">
      <h2>6. Interpreting the System Explorer</h2>
      <p>
        In the System Explorer, the green curve represents the feasible envelope
        computed by the model. The dashed horizontal line shows the electrolyzer
        capacity limit, while the green dot indicates the current operating
        point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving the sliders shifts this operating point within the envelope. The
        interpretation panel explains which constraint is active and why further
        increases in certain parameters may or may not increase hydrogen
        production.
